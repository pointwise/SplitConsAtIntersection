Copyright 2021 Cadence Design Systems, Inc. All rights reserved worldwide.

A Pointwise Glyph script to split two connectors wherever they happen to intersect.

## Operation
Select two connectors and run *SplitConsAtIntersection.glf*. If no connectors have been selected, running the script will prompt the user to select two connectors. 

Execute *SplitConsAtIntersection-GUI.glf* if a user interface is desired. Upon execution, a Tk window will open with buttons that enable the selection of each connector.
